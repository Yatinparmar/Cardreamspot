== Description ==

Automotive Store – The most innovative Car Dealership WordPress Theme. It can be used to create a magnificent automotive website. This theme is ultra easy to use and very flexible. You can customize options without knowing any programming – change colors, images, sizes, spaces, and placement of any elements just via drag-and-drop. Vehica includes a powerful Vehicle Inventory module that allows you to modify all vehicle fields and search forms with just a few clicks. Your final website done via Automotive Store will be very quick and will work perfectly on mobile devices and tablets. Choosing Vehica is a great investment because you will have outstanding website without losing a lot of time or energy setting it up and managing it. 
Single Click Import – Demo and all pages are automatically imported after 1 click. It will save you time and allow you to quickly start your customizations. Demo package do not include users photos and has only few sample cars added.
Basic Setup Panel – After a few minutes your website will be totally yours! All in one place, you can select your primary color, add your phone number, email, upload your logo, and it will immediately be added everywhere on your website. With a single click you can delete all demo vehicles and have your website ready for its first visitors. Could it be easier or faster?
Globally Adaptable – You can translate all texts into any language, change currency, and switch between number formats and metrics. No extra software / plugin required for translation and adaptation. You just type your newly translated text into the panel and click Save. You can also have multiple currencies at the same time.
Powerful Vehicles Inventory – You can change the look of your vehicle inventory by creating your own fields and modifying the existing options. There are 6 types of fields: Text, Number, Taxonomy, Price, Gallery, Embed (Video).
Advanced Search Functionality – Search forms are critical in the Automotive business, so we’ve spent hundreds of hours testing and improving the Vehica search function. The result? A quick and flexible search engine that can be customized to fit your customers’ needs, allowing them to search for vehicles based on their specific criteria.
Inventory Instant Results – Search results are updated after each selection. This way your users are immediately informed of “how many vehicles left.” It provides a much better user experience than a classic “Search” button. Reloading is very fast, and users will love to use it. They will also avoid a “0 Results” found situation by typing in too many criteria. It reduces bounce rate and it is why all popular big companies have “instant results without reloading a page” after each criteria is changed. It is technologically very advanced, and it is why most other themes do not have it.
Field Relationships – Need to connect your Make field to your Model field? Create an unlimited number of relationships between search fields to automatically filter your search options and create a faster, more user-friendly experience.
Relevant Fields – Your visitors only need to see fields that are relevant for their search, e.g., different fields for motorcycles than for trucks. You can create these kinds of relationships so the user experience is much smoother and you can build perfect motors website.
Elementor Plugin Integration – Vehica is based on Elementor Free plugin and we spend thousands of hours to add extra value to it. Create Any Website You Can Imagine. You can modify everything: Homepage, all pages (e.g., Contact / About), Single Vehicle Page, Results Page, User Page. It is the most flexible and easy to use solution on the market for motors website. Our developers created 30+ new elements that you can “drag-and-drop” to make sure page builder is ultra flexible and fully integrated with Vehica. Elementor Pro (paid) version is not required to run Vehica, but if you like to use it this product is fully compatible.
Monetization System – WooCommerce Payment Gateways – Vehica has monetization system that allow you to earn when users submit listings. You can configure: PayPal, Stripe, Visa, Mastercard, Wire Transfer, Square, Apple Pay, Alipay, Braintree, PayU, PayFast, SecurePay, Authorize.Net, 2checkout, Amazon Pay, PagSeguro and many many other WooCommerce Payment Getaways. Please consider Vehica do not have WooCommerce Shop functionality – this integration is related to receiving payments when visitors submit new listing.
Flexible Menu – Vehica has a great menu that includes sticky and transparent options. Mobile menu was designed as off-canvas.
Global Body & Headings Google Fonts – Choose body and heading font in your setup panel. It will automatically be displayed on all of your pages. 800+ fonts available.
Private Seller / Business Seller User Roles – You can create a WordPress account that can only add vehicles and does not have access to admin functions. Great to delegate adding vehicles to other people.
Blog – Everything you need to start blogging is already integrated into MyHome. You can easily customize single post page via drag-and-drop options – change order of sections, colors, and more.
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) – SEO is a must for any WordPress theme, but we’ve taken it one step further. Vehica helps Google understand your content with optimized headings, URL structure and more. Vehica also fully supports the Yoast plugin to give your SEO rankings that extra boost. It is an ultra-fast and light product so Google scores it higher in search results (your website speed is one of the key factors of position). Are you ready to get it for now?
